# Multi-locale Angular App with SSR (Web Build) & Capacitor (iOS & Android Builds)

## Prerequisite
- Node.js 20.19.0+

## Installation
```bash
# create new project
ng new angular-multi-locale-ssr-capacitor --style=scss --ssr --server-routing
cd angular-multi-locale-ssr-capacitor

# add localize
ng add --skip-confirmation @angular/localize
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```
